## Prep
BEFORE THE MEETING 10 MINS
Review the GROW coaching model and questions in this play. You might want to rephrase some of the questions in your own ‘voice' to feel more authentic, or even create your own questions. 

Before your team member attends the session, invite them to think about what they would like coaching on - it could be an upcoming presentation, a challenging stakeholder, starting a difficult task, making a decision, etc.

Adopt the mindset of a Coach which are:
- Listen actively - pay attention to verbal [tone, volume, pitch and pace] and non-verbal [facial expressions, energy, body language] messages
- More ask - less tell [aim for 80:20 - 80% they talk, 20% you talk… to ask the next great question]
- Be 100% present and focused on this person
- Be aware of your own biases and judgements
- Be flexible - you may circle back through each step
- Be comfortable with silence - use pauses to encourage your team member to speak

## Conversation

## BRAINSTORM OPTIONS 20 MINS

- Who will you talk to?
- How committed are you to taking that action?
- Is there anything you need to put in place before then?
- How will you know you’re making progress?

Learning how to understand the point of view of others (their thoughts, feelings, opinions, ideas, experiences) is an important way to develop your Empathy.  It will improve your interactions with others, help you foster genuine compassion and enable you connect positively with your team.

### Section 1
REFLECT ON YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE 10 MINS
Think about your own experiences and point of view
- What information or data are you using?
- What are you thinking, assuming, expecting?
- What are you feeling? How are these emotions showing up for you?
- What have you tried in the past? What happened?
- What do you want, and why? What don’t you want, and why?

:check_mark: Pro Tip: Be completely honest, especially about how you are feeling and how this 
shows up for you.  Being aware of your emotions is the first step in being able to control and harness them.

- What are they thinking, assuming, expecting?
- What might they feeling, based on what you have observed? 
- What have they tried in the past? What happened?
- What do they want, and why? What do they not want, and why?

Introduction
During difficult times, your team members may experience feelings of panic, fear, isolation, loneliness, depression, burnout, dis-engagement and possibly even trauma. They may shut down or become defensive, and that is completely natural. TEAM Anywhere gives us more choice than ever about when and how we work.  However, working in a distributed environment can sometimes exacerbate these negative feelings. As a people manager, how can you recognise the cues and signals that might indicate your team member is struggling - and what can you do to help? This play, along with the 4 Flags, has been designed to help you with this.

Learn how to work out if your team member is just having a bad day, or if there are flags that indicate they may be struggling with burnout, their wellbeing or mental health.  Then determine the right action to take.  You can use this play with individual team members or for your whole team. 

You can complete this play as part of the Lead Anywhere Series or you can do this on your own. 

## Use this play to…
Have 1:1s that matter

Build rapport and trust with your team members

Better identify and manage the impact of burnout on team members

Improve your Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and Empathy

Identify how you can better support the mental health and wellbeing of your team members 

The reality is, we all have bad days, and our energy levels go up and down. But if you start to notice that your team members are having bad days on a more regular basis, they seem exhausted or burnt out, or if they are behaving in a way that is uncharacteristic for them, this may indicate that something deeper is going on for them. 

As a people manager, it is your responsibility to provide your team members with the support they need.

Who should be involved
This play can be done by a leader either alone or with the support of their own leader or an HR Business Partner.

1:1 Notes :notepad_spiral: 

Prep 
10 MINS

Read the 4 Flags Hack and What's the ONE thing a people leader can do?

### Section 1
INTERACT WITH YOUR TEAM MEMBERS 
30-60 MINS

Have you met 1:1 with your team member in the last 5 days?

Have you asked them these questions:

What are your priorities?

How can I help you?

How are you feeling?

If you answered NO to the above, here and schedule a 1:1 for this week - read What's the ONE thing a people leader can do? for tips on a great 1:1

Consider using a Poll in Slack to pulse check your team’s level of burnout.

:check_mark: Pro Tip: You should be having weekly 1:1s with all your team members.

### Section 2
CHECK YOUR DATA 
15 MINS

Have you read your latest TIP results?

What trends are you seeing around Work Happiness, Engagement and Stress?

What are your team’s verbatims telling you?

Do you have Workday data you can draw on? Eg. sick leave, annual leave, carers leave.

:check_mark: Pro Tip: If there aren’t enough people on your team to get TIP data (you need a minimum of 5 responses) you could work with your own leader to get a broader view across multiple teams - it won’t be specific to your team, but will give you an idea.

### Section 3
APPLY THE 4 FLAGS 
15 MINS

Think about your team member and reflect on:

The interactions you have had with them in the last few weeks

What you have discussed in their 1:1s

Any feedback or comments you have heard about them from others 

For each of the 4 Flags, identify if there is anything that the team member has been doing more regularly lately, or is out of character for them:

:flag_white: White Flags (Language) - what has your team member been saying and how have they been saying it?

:flag_on: Red Flags (Performance) - how is your team member working; are they doing too much or too little?

:flag_black: Black Flags (Behaviour) - what is your team member doing, how are they ‘showing up’ on :zoom: :slack: :confluence: :gmail:?

:pirate_flag: Danger Flags (Take Action Now) - are there signs that your team member may need immediate support or intervention?

:check_mark: Pro Tip: We all have bad days, but when the bad days become bad weeks or months, we may need more support from our people leader and Atlassian.

### Section 4
MEET WITH YOUR TEAM MEMBER 
30 MINS

Spend more time with your team member to:

Raise your concerns with them and share that you want to support them

Ask them if they are ok

Explore what might be going on for them.  Some examples might be:

They feel isolated and don’t have access to the right information tools, resources or people

They feel lonely and need more connection

They are being mistreated or bullied by others

They feel bored or under-utilised

They are struggling to balance work and home demands (eg. homeschooling, caring for a family member)

They have health or financial challenges 

They don’t enjoy their work or feel at a dead end

Ask them what support they want or need

Explore what you can do together to help them

:check_mark: Pro Tip: Avoid making assumptions about what might be going on for your team member.  Take the time to understand their experiences. 

### Section 5
TAKE ACTION 
15 MINS

Follow up with your team member on your agreed actions.  These could include:

Access to the Modern Health page with certified counsellors and many other tools and resources that support wellbeing 

Modified work schedules

Time off

Reprioritisation of projects

More time together in 1:1s

Dedicated ‘connecting’ time with the team, or with individuals

Reducing pressure to ‘be live’ on zoom all the time - giving permission to switch off camera, being ruthless about the meetings they attend

Coaching from the people leader

Clarity on role and performance expectations

Performance priorities (to help reduce feelings of overwhelm)

:check_mark: Pro Tip: Spend time with your team member - even if you don’t identify any Flags of concern, your team members want your attention. So give it to them!
